## Checkpoint: FashionVision Challenge – Fashion-MNIST Classification 

### Task:
Build a PyTorch CNN model to classify grayscale images of fashion items into 10 classes.

### Dataset:
- Fashion-MNIST (28×28 grayscale images)
- 10 categories including shirts, sneakers, trousers, and bags

### Tools & Libraries:
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- sklearn (for train/val split)
- pandas & numpy

### What I Did:
- Preprocessed data (normalized pixel values, reshaped images)
- Built a LeNet-like CNN using `nn.Sequential`:
  - 2 Conv layers
  - 2 AvgPool layers
  - Fully connected classifier
- Used Adam optimizer & CrossEntropyLoss
- Trained for 20 epochs with batch size 64
- Achieved **89.40%** validation accuracy (fill in your value)

### Output:
- Created `submission.csv` with model predictions for test set

### What I Learned:
- Building CNNs using PyTorch modules
- Preprocessing custom datasets using `torch.utils.data.Dataset`
